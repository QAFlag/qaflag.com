# Install the CLI

First, you will want to install the CLI globally. You only need to do this once on your machine, not once per project. Choose the appropriate command based on your package manager of choice.

```bash
// NPM
npm i -g @qaflag/cli

// Yarn
yarn global add @qaflag/cli

// PNPM
pnpm add -g @qaflag/cli
```

You can verify that it is installed and check which version, by typing:

```bash
qaflag --version
```
