# Install the CLI

First, you will want to install the CLI globally. You only need to do this once on your machine, not once per project. Choose the appropriate command based on your package manager of choice.

```bash
// NPM
npm i -g @qaflag/cli

// Yarn
yarn global add @qaflag/cli

// PNPM
pnpm add -g @qaflag/cli
```

You should now be able to run the command and see available options:

```bash
qaflag --help
```

If you want to check what versino of the CLI is installed:

```bash
qaflag --version
```
